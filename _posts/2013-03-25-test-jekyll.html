	<h1>.net award nominee</h1>

	<p>I’m absolutely thrilled, humbled and delighted to announce that I’ve been
	nominated for <a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">.net’s Young Developer of the Year award, 2013!</a></p>

	<p>I do feel a bit of a fraud in that I’ve been doing this internet thing for ages
	now – and because <a href="https://twitter.com/csswizardry/status/277793781300994049">most people think I’m around 27</a> –
	but sure enough, enough people (you guys!) put my name forward for the category
	that I’m into the official 12! I’m up against some <em>real</em> talent as well, which I
	think says a lot about the quality of the industry’s young devs.</p>

	<p>The next stage is the public (you guys again!) vote. You can cast votes for who
	<em>you</em> believe deserves to make the final three; the final three then go onto a
	judged decision ‘behind closed doors’.</p>

	<p>This post is, predictably, me trying to garner support from you lot. If you…</p>

	<ul>
		<li>…have ever read and enjoyed any of my posts here on CSS Wizardry</li>
		<li>…used any of my open source stuff in your work</li>
		<li>…received any advice or help from me via email or on Twitter</li>
		<li>…enjoyed and/or learned anything from any of my talks</li>
		<li>…benefitted in <em>any</em> way, shape, or form from anything I’ve done in the web development world</li>
	</ul>


	<p>…then I would be <em>super</em> grateful for any support. You can cast your vote at
	<a href="http://www.thenetawards.com/">thenetawards.com</a></p>

	<p>Thanks so much!</p>
