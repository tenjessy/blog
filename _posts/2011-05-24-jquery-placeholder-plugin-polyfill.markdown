My good friend, ex-colleague and all round awesome dude [Dan Bentley](http://twitter.com/dan_bentley) has made a great little [jQuery placeholder plugin](https://github.com/danbentley/placeholder) which polyfills older browsers that don't support the new HTML5 form attribute `placeholder`.

Now I'll readily admit that Dan has done 99% of the work here, but it has been something of a joint project in that:





  * I actually made him build it cos he's amazing at JS and I needed it.


  * I've added a tiny, tiny bit of CSS/UI behaviour.



There's my 1%.

Anyway, follow [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/danbentley/placeholder), follow [Dan on Twitter](http://twitter.com/dan_bentley) [and GitHub](https://github.com/danbentley/) and let us know if you use it!
