Today I was somewhat surprised to receive a tweet from one of my (I'm guessing newer) followers saying he was 'disappointed that I tweet personal content from this account' and that he 'expects more CSS related content'. I'm not going to link to the tweet, because I feel that's not necessary, but I was a little taken aback. Here's my open reply...





**N.B.** This article is not aimed directly at the person who sent the tweet, rather an open letter to everyoneâ€¦



CSS Wizardry is my own personal branding. It started off as my portfolio back in 2007 when I was 17. Since then it has transformed as I released more and more tutorial and resource content, and started writing in-depth articles. I also joined [Twitter](http://twitter.com/csswizardry) to help spread my personal brand to reach a wider audience. Twitter, along with some very high brow followers I am both pleased and humbled to have acquired, has been a massive force in CSS Wizardry's expansion.

Since its inception, CSS Wizardry has remained free to use<del>, and free of ads</del>. <del>I currently do not monetise CSS Wizardry whatsoever.</del> Cheeky wee ad in the sidebar. I have provided hours and hours and _hours_ of decent, insightful content at no cost to my followers/readers and have not directly collected a penny for myself from doing so. CSS Wizardry costs me massively in both time writing content, and money in hosting etc. I give a lot away for nothing, and actually at cost to myself.

I was conscious some time ago that I had a few personal articles on CSS Wizardry which I thought were perhaps out of place, so I created my even-more-personal site at [harryroberts.co.uk](http://harryroberts.co.uk/) to house all that stuff.



People like to follow people, otherwise they'd just read RSS feeds...



If you really don't want any personal stuff appearing via Twitter then simply don't follow me. If you _just_ want web development content then subscribe to [the feed](/feed/), but please please please...

Play fair, CSS Wizardry is a time and cash investment on my part to provide good quality content for you for free. Don't bitch about it, ey? That's just ungrateful...
