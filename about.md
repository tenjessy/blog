# About me

Hi there, I’m Harry Roberts. I am a 22 year old front-end architect and web
developer from Leeds, UK.

I [write](/archive/) and [speak](/speaking/) on the topics of CSS and its scalability,
architecture, maintenance and more. I work as a <b>Senior UI Developer</b> for
one of the UK’s biggest media and entertainment companies, [BSkyB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB).
I am a [.net awards finalist](http://www.netmagazine.com/features/net-awards-2011-10-brilliant-newcomers)
and a member of Smashing Magazine’s Experts Panel. For a more exhaustive profile,
please see [my CV](http://csswizardry.com/cv/).

I specialise in writing and scaling CSS for large apps and websites, with a
strong focus on OOCSS, pragmatism and powerful and rapid development. I also love
tinkering with front-end performance, Git, Vim and other cool (nerdy) stuff.

## Contact

If you want to get in touch with me feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com).
I aim to respond to every email I get but I am usually kept pretty busy – if I
don’t get to replying right away please do chase me up.


For more casual contact please [fire me a tweet](http://twitter.com/?status=Hey,%20@csswizardry%20).
I am **not** currently accepting any freelance work and will consider any
speaking requests on a case-by-case basis.

## inuit.css

[inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com) is a mature, open source, totally free project of
mine; it is a powerful, scalable, Sass-based, BEM, OOCSS framework. It is
designed to be small enough to be suited to small sites, but powerful enough to
scale to sites with several thousand pages. It is the culmination of years of
my work and experience on projects of all sizes. You should check it out,
it totally rocks!

## Colophon

This site is built on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), an open-source
static site generator. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
This site also utilises [inuit.css](http://inuitcss.com), a free and open-source
CSS framework developed and maintained by me.

This site is developed quite openly; the source is available to poke through in
its own [GitHub repo](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com).
This code is made available for people to look through and hopefully learn from,
however this code is _not_ available for your use and, remains under my copyright.
If you notice anything wrong with the site, or would like to suggest a feature,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com/issues).

**N.B.** This site was ported from WordPress to Jekyll in December, 2012; there
is every chance that certain things before then will not look quite right now.
If you spot anything, I’d be super grateful if you could let me know.
