# Speaking engagements

I occasionally speak at conferences, more than likely on the topic of CSS, and
writing it in big teams in a manner that scales. If you would like me to speak
at a conference you are organising, please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com).

I am set to speak at:

<ul class="block-list">
  <li><a href="http://industryconf.com/">Industry Conf</a>, UK, Apr 2013</li>
</ul>

I have previously been fortunate enough to speak at:

<ul class="block-list">
  <li><a href="http://thedigitalbarn.co.uk/">Digital Barn</a>, UK, Feb 2012</li>
  <li><a href="http://2012.front-trends.com/">Front-Trends</a>, Poland, Apr 2012</li>
  <li><a href="http://2012.canvasconf.co.uk/">Canvas</a>, UK, Sep 2012</li>
  <li><a href="http://thedigitalbarn.co.uk/">Digital Barn</a>, UK, Sep 2012</li>
</ul>
